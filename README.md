This dataset was created as an experiment with hopes of being useful.

[Dataset statistics](STATS.md)

- After reaching 9 million domains I've switched to archived storage.
  Please use freely available [XZ](https://tukaani.org/xz/) to unpack files.

- After reaching 30 million domains I've moved domain directories to `/data`
  so repository doesn't have it's README at the very bottom.

- [x] 20 Million
- [x] 30 Million
- [ ] 50 Million
- [ ] 100 Million
